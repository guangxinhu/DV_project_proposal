# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is an earthquake data.</br>

The origin of database is [National Geophysical Data Center / World Data Service (NGDC/WDS): Significant Earthquake Database. National Geophysical Data Center, NOAA.](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1).</br>

The Significant Earthquake Database contains information on destructive earthquakes from 1970 to the present that meet at least one of the following criteria: Moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), 10 or more deaths, Magnitude 7.5 or greater, Modified Mercalli Intensity X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami.


## Prototypes

### Scatter Plot

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. </br>

Each point represents an earthquake event.</br>

The x-coordinate represents the different years, and the y-coordinate represents the earthquake magnitude. The color of circle indicates the duration of earthquake.

### Map Plot

In addition to simply representing seismic data in a coordinate system based on numerical values, mapping seismic data on a map can give people a more intuitive sense of earthquake distribution. Therefore, the visualization effect of the whole data can also be observed with the knowledge of the location of the seismic belt.

### Earthquake Map



## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Which areas are prone to earthquakes, which areas do not often occur in the earthquake.
 * Which places are prone to high magnitude earthquakes.
 * Which places are prone to earthquakes of longer duration.
 * The occurrence and distribution of important earthquakes around the world in different years.
 * Which earthquake triggered the Tsunami.
 * If I can, try to realize 'zoom' function for map.
