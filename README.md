## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is an erthquake data in Turekey.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches
A slideable timeline is added to the data visualizations at intervals of five years. The map shows the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes in different regions every five years.

## Open Questions
 * There are some data names in the dataset, and I don't know what they mean 
 * I want to draw earthquake maps according to Turkish cities, but there are too many different cities in the data set. Is it a good idea to merge the data of cities according to region first?
