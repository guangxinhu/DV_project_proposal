# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is an earthquake data.</br>

The origin of database is [National Geophysical Data Center / World Data Service (NGDC/WDS): Significant Earthquake Database. National Geophysical Data Center, NOAA.](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1).</br>

The Significant Earthquake Database contains information on destructive earthquakes from 1970 to the present that meet at least one of the following criteria: Moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), 10 or more deaths, Magnitude 7.5 or greater, Modified Mercalli Intensity X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami.


## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. </br>

Each point represents an earthquake event.</br>

The x-coordinate represents the different years, and the y-coordinate represents the earthquake magnitude. The color of circle indicates the duration of earthquake.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Based Turkey map, the occurrence of earthquakes every five years can be shown on it.
 * If click the certain city on map, more earthquake information will be shown.
 * The data set also includes many earthquake-related statistics. This project will also analyze the relationship and connection between various seismic features.
 * If possible, a prediction map of future earthquakes will be sketched based on previous earthquake information.
